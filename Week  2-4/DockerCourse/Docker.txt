 docke ris responsible for creating and managing objects such as imeges , containers ,volumes, and network on a host.
 the rest API provieds an interface to manage objects in Docker
 the docker CLI is the command line interface that we use to run command to mange objects in Docker
 libcontainer is written in go the same programming language that docker is written in and reduce docker dependency on the kernal LXC technology with libcontainer docker could now directly interact with the linux kernal features such as namespaces and cgroups (the default execution environment of docker) 
 docker image : is a read only template used for creating a docker container (could be base images of OS or apps like webservers or databses )	
 docker container : running instance of an image (read write template ) ceate start stop move delete a container using Docker CLI or the api .
 docker network : help in implementing various solutions for containers to be able to communicate with each other 
 when the container dies all the data died 
 docker volumes : help in persisting data across container restarts 
 image registry :stores docker images and is used publish and share images publicly or withna private organization , docker hub is a public registry that anyone can use , docker is config to look for images on docker hub by defalut 
 
 unix socket is an ipc or inter-process communication mechanism that used between different processes on the same host *Docker deamon is only accessible within the same host and the docker CLi 
 the docker deamon is not accessible outside of the docker host because its only listening on th unix socket  so we cane make it to listen on a TCP interface on the docker host by adding the host option while running the docker deamin command line  in this case our host happens to have an interface 
 
 the command line utility used to manage docker objests is called docker itself .
